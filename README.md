This repository contains my completed work for Home Assignment 4 of CS5710 Machine Learning.
The assignment covers:

Hierarchical clustering (Single-Link & Average-Link)

Distance matrix computation

K-Means clustering setup

Short-answer conceptual questions

NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords, lemmatization, POS filtering)

Named Entity Recognition (NER) and pronoun ambiguity detection

All code is implemented in clean Python with comments for readability.
